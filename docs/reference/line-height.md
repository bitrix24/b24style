## Relative line-heights {#relative-line-heights}

Use the `leading-reset`, `leading-none`, `leading-3xs`, `leading-tight`, `leading-2xs`, `leading-sm`, `leading-snug`, `leading-md`, `leading-lg`, `leading-normal`, `leading-xl`, `leading-relaxed`, `leading-2xl`, `leading-3xl`  and `leading-loose` utilities to give an element a relative line-height based on its current font-size.

## Fixed line-heights {#fixed-line-heights}

Use utilities like `leading-3` and `leading-10` to give an element a fixed line-height, irrespective of the current font-size. These are useful when you need very precise control over an elementâ€™s final size.
